 * Scenario: Poison Spread in a Battlefield Grid
 *
 * You are given a 2D grid where:
 * - 0 represents an empty cell
 * - 1 represents an enemy
 *
 * A poison is cast on one enemy at a specific position (startRow, startCol).
 * From that point, the poison spreads to adjacent enemies (up, down, left, right)
 * with a 15% chance per neighbor.
 *
 * Each "wave" of poison takes 1 second to propagate outward from currently poisoned enemies.
 * Enemies can only be poisoned once, and the spread continues until no new enemies are poisoned in a wave.
 *
 * Objective:
 * - Simulate the spread of poison.
 * - Return:
 *     - The total number of enemies poisoned
 *     - The number of waves it took before the poison stopped spreading
 *
 * Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to simulate the wave-by-wave spread of poison.
 * Track visited enemies to prevent re-poisoning.
